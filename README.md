"# Twitter-Clone"

This is a project built using the MERN stack, mostly: React.js, MongoDB, Node.js, Express, and Tailwind.

It authenticates using JsonWebTokens JWT. React Query to fetch Data and caching.
It has the ability to create posts, delete, like, suggest users to follow, edit profile info, edit cover and profile images, send notifications, and much more.

Unfortunately, I'm still not too versed with the whole topic of deployment and so I can't really offer a live demo, however, I will be adding some screens for clarity.
